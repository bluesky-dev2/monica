**Introducing a new product changes section**

There is a new header now in Monica. It shows a bell that slowly pulsate, with a red dot, if there is a new feature or an important change in the application. You will not have to find out by yourself what has changed in the product.

**New relationships**

You now have much more control on how you link contacts together.

Before you could only have parent/child relationships and significant other relationships. Now you can have much more types of relationships, like uncle/nephew, lover, coworker, and so on. We hope you will like what we have done.
