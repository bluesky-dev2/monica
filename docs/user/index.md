## Security

If the option is set, you can add a [Multi Factor Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) device to secure your connection.
You can either:

- add a 2FA security device, using an OTP application on your mobile phone
- or add a [U2F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor) key. This one has limitations:
    - the instance must run with `https` connection.
    - you must use Chrome or Opera. Firefox Quantum needs an [additional setting](https://www.yubico.com/2017/11/how-to-navigate-fido-u2f-in-firefox-quantum/). Older versions of Firefox need you to install the [U2F Support extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/u2f-support-add-on/).
